/*PROGRAMMING PROJECT:
 * Write a Java program that simulates a system that supports the functions of an e-book reader. 
 * You should include methods for users of your system to “buy” new
    books, view their list of purchased books, and read their purchased books. Your
    system should use actual books, which have expired copyrights and are available
    on the Internet, to populate your set of available books for users of your system
    to “purchase” and read.
